# **Chapter 8 - Goroutines and Channels**

## **8.1. Goroutines**

### **Overview**

<p style="text-align:justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goroutines are functions or methods that run concurrently with other functions or methods. Goroutines can be thought of as <u>light weight threads</u>. The cost of creating a Goroutine is tiny when compared to a thread. Hence its common for Go applications to have thousands of Goroutines running concurrently.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every program contains at least a single Goroutine and that Goroutine is known as the <b>main Goroutine</b>. All the Goroutines are working under the main Goroutines if the main Goroutine terminated, then all the goroutine present in the program also terminated. Goroutine always works in the background.

### **Advantages of Goroutines over Thread**

- <p style="text-align:justify">Goroutines are cheaper than threads.</p>
- <p style="text-align:justify">Goroutine are stored in the stack and the size of the stack can grow and shrink according to the requirement of the program. But in threads, the size of the stack is fixed.</p>
- <p style="text-align:justify">Goroutines can communicate using <b>the channel</b> and these channels are specially designed to prevent <b>race conditions</b> when accessing shared memory using Goroutines. Channels can be thought of as <b>a pipe</b> using which Goroutines communicate.</p>
- <p style="text-align:justify">Suppose a program has one thread, and that thread has many Goroutines associated with it. If any of Goroutine blocks the thread due to resource requirement then all the remaining Goroutines will assign to a newly created OS thread. All these details are hidden from the programmers.</p>

### **Channels**
<p style="text-align:justify;"></p>

### **Deadlock**

### **Cancellation**

### **What is Race Condition?**

### **Mutex**

### **Concurrency Patterns**

### **fan-in & fan-out**
<p style="text-align:justify;">fan-in is a multiplexing strategy where the inputs of several channels are combined to produce an output channel. fan-out is demultiplexing strategy where a single channel is split into multiple channels.</p>
